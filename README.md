visualization of major historical events


For this project, imagine that the Institute for Public Policy has employed you to analyze and create a visualization as part of a larger initiative it’s working on.
In this scenario, the institute believes that past events heavily influence the current geopolitical climate. To delve deeper into this hypothesis, a clearer understanding of the historical relationships between countries in the twentieth century is needed.
Suitable results can be achieved by looking at major global events throughout the twentieth century. To do so, you’ll need to give a visualization and an analysis of the chain of events that led to the current state of affairs. To be effective, your visualization must highlight these past relationships. This way, other researchers can understand and tie your findings into the final report.
